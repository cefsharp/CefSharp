CefSharp - Embedded Chromium for .Net
=====================================

This project contains .Net CLR bindings for The [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/ "Google Code") by Marshall A. Greenblatt.  The bindings are written in C++/CLI but can be used from any CLR language e.g. C# or VB.  See the CefTest project for an example web browser built using this library.
