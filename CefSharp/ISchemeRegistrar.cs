        /// In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the form:

        /// domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [13] and Section 2.1 of
        /// RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path" in the
        /// simplest case and "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most
        /// explicit case. For example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path"
