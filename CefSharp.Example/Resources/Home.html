                        Welcome to CefSharp! We are excited about you being here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, what is CefSharp, really? You probably have a bit of a clue already, since you've actually managed to
                        download (and perhaps even compile) the software. Nonetheless, let's try to explain it in a few bullet
                        points:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A framework</strong> for embedding web-browsing-like capabilities to a standard .NET
                                application (WPF or Windows Forms).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>A set of high-level custom controls</strong> to make it reasonably easy to integrate
                                these capabilities in your application.

                    </div>
                    <p class="lead">
                        When getting started with CefSharp it's important to understand a few basics.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Initialize/Shutdown Cef</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's important to note that it's nessicary to Initialize the underlying CEF library. This can be achieved in one of two ways, explicitly and implicitly.
                        When you create a new instance of ChromiumWebBrowser it will check if CEF has been initialized and if not, initialize it for you with the defaults.
                        For those wishing to specify some custom settings then you can explicitly initialize CEF yourself like below

                        <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        public static void Init()
                        {
                            var settings = new CefSettings();
                                        
                            // Increase the log severity so CEF outputs detailed information, useful for debugging
                            settings.LogSeverity = LogSeverity.Verbose;
                                        
                            Cef.Initialize(settings);
                        }
                        </pre>
                        
                        CEF also requires that you call Shutdown when your finished with it. If you don't call Shutdown explicitly then it will be called for you on exit.
                        You can call Shutdown explicitly which will be required in some instances.

                        <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        private static void OnApplicationExit(object sender, EventArgs e)
                        {
                            Cef.Shutdown();
                        }
                        </pre>
                        
                        It's important to note CEF that Initialize/Shutdown <strong>MUST</strong> be called on your main applicaiton thread (Typically the UI thead). If you call them on different
                        threads, your application will hang.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Settings and Command Line Arguments</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many settings and command line arguments that can influence the way CEF behaves. Here are some examples

                        <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        public static void Init()
                        {
                            // Specify Global Settings and Command Line Arguments
                            var settings = new CefSettings();
                                        
                            // By default CEF uses an in memory cache, to save cached data e.g. passwords you need to specify a cache path
                            // NOTE: The executing user must have sufficent privileges to write to this folder.
                            settings.CachePath = "cache";

                            // There are many command line arguments that can either be turned on or off
                            
                            // Enable WebRTC                            
                            settings.CefCommandLineArgs.Add("enable-media-stream", "1");

                            // Don't use a proxy server, always make direct connections. Overrides any other proxy server flags that are passed.
                            // Slightly improves Cef initialize time as it won't attempt to resolve a proxy
                            settings.CefCommandLineArgs.Add("no-proxy-server", "1"); 

                                        
                            Cef.Initialize(settings);
                        }
                        </pre>

                        There are some settings which can be applied to a specific ChromiumWebBrowser instance. Note BrowserSettings are set slightly different in WPF than WinForms
                        see the example projects for more information.

                        <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        var browser = new ChromiumWebBrowser(url)
                        {
                            BrowserSettings =
                            {
                                DefaultEncoding = "UTF-8",
                                WebGl = CefState.Disabled
                            }
                        };
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="bs-docs-section">
                    <div class="page-header">

                    </div>
                    <h3>State-of-the-art HTML5 and Javascript support</h3>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps very obvious, but still worth mentioning. Since CefSharp is based on
                        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef">CEF</a>, which is in turn based on
                        <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> (version 43 for the time being), CefSharp provides
                        one of the best HTML5 rendering experiences available -

                    <h3>Support for both x86 and x64</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chromium 47 supports both x86 and x64, and so do we as of CefSharp 47.0.0 For the time being, it does not
                        "auto-detect" the platform being used (since this is quite complex), so you have to choose either one for
                        your project. This practically means that you will have to compile &amp; package separate
                        binaries/installers of your app for x86 and x64 respectively if you want/need to support both of them.

                                        mimeType = ResourceHandler.GetMimeType(fileExtension);
                                        
                                        // When your finished processing execute the callback.
                                        // Most callbacks have multiple methods, so checkout their interface for details
                                        callback.Continue();
                                    }
                                });

                                // Return true to indicate that you've handled the request, you can return false which will cancel the request
                                return true;
                            }

                            public Stream GetResponse(IResponse response, out long responseLength, out string redirectUrl)
                            {
                                // NOTE: GetResponse will be executed after you have called Continue()
                                // You simple need to populate the relevant details, note you can also redirec to another url if required
                                responseLength = stream.Length;
                                redirectUrl = null;
                                response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK;
                                response.StatusText = "OK";
                                response.MimeType = mimeType;
                                return stream;
                            }
                        }
                        </pre>
                        Finally, you have to register this scheme handler using some code like this:

                        <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        public static void Init()
                        {
                            // Pseudo code; you probably need more in your CefSettings also.
                            var settings = new CefSettings();
                                        
                            settings.RegisterScheme(new CefCustomScheme
                            {
                                SchemeName = CefSharpSchemeHandlerFactory.SchemeName,
                                SchemeHandlerFactory = new CefSharpSchemeHandlerFactory()
                            });
                                        
                            Cef.Initialize(settings);
                        }
                        </pre>
                        It's important that the scheme registration takes place before the <code>Cef.Initialize()</code> gets
                        called. (This is different to how things was being done in CefSharp version 1.)
                    </p>
                    <h4>Asynchrony</h4>
                    <p>
                        CefSharp supports custom schemes using an
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O">asynchronous</a> pattern, which is desirable if
                        your custom scheme handler performs e.g. network requests or other long-running operations. In other, more
                        trivial cases (e.g. if you are just serving out static content which is already loaded in memory), you can
                        just signal using the <code>requestCompletedCallback()</code> straight away, as in the example above.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="features-javascript-integration">JavaScript integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are reading this page in either one of the <strong>CefSharp.Wpf.Example</strong> or
                        <strong>CefSharp.WinForms.Example</strong> sample applications, you can use the boxes on the right side
                        of the screen to run arbitrary JavaScript code towards the context of this page. By default, the content
                        of the block below will be modified/inspected by the script code.

                        <pre id="modify-me">You can modify the value of this text field using JavaScript!</pre>

                        The C# code for performing these kinds of interactions is quite simple. Like this:
                    </p>

                    <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        webBrowser.ExecuteScriptAsync(someScriptCode);
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        The code above will run the provided JavaScript snippet (which may do interesting things, like
                        interrogating or modifying the DOM of the page, just to name one example out of many potential ones). The
                        execution is of the "fire-and-forget" style; any result of the execution is silently disregarded. The
                        execution is also <em>asynchronous</em> in nature, a term which means that (among other things) the method
                        may return before the actual code has actually been executed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the preferrably approach if possible, since it does not deadlock the UI in any way. However, we
                        realize that it's not suitable for all scenarios. Have faith &mdash; there is a solution even for cases
                        where you <em>do</em> need to return a value. Just write your code like this:
                    </p>

                    <pre data-shbrush="csharp">
                        var result = webBrowser.EvaluateScript("10 + 20");
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Please note that only a limited number of data types are supported when returning the result above. Simple
                        value types (int, float, etc) and strings all work, but do not expect to be able to return other JavaScript
                        objects.
                    </p>
