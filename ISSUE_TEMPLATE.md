So you have a question to ask, where can you look for answers? Read on. Think you've found a bug? Please take the time to fill out the bug report below, provide as much information as you can, make sure you provide information for every heading. Thank you! We'd like to keep issues exclusively for **bug reports**, so please ask your questions on `Gitter`

- Start by reading the General Usage guide, it answers all the common questions https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/General-Usage
- Check out the FAQ, lots of useful information there, specially if your having trouble deploying to a different machine : https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions
- GitHub proves a fantastic search feature, it'll search through past issues and code. So check that out (Search box at the top of this page) : https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp
- You can see all the `CefSharp` tagged issues on `Stackoverflow`, some useful stuff there : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cefsharp
- You can search the `Gitter Chat Channel` for past questions/conversations, you can search through every discussion from the beginning : https://gitter.im/cefsharp/CefSharp

Still have a question? Great, ask it on `Gitter`. https://gitter.im/cefsharp/CefSharp

**Note: CefSharp is just a wrapper around the Chromium Embedded Project, it's worth searching http://magpcss.org/ceforum/index.php if your problem involves a low level Chromium error message**

We ask that you put in a reasonable amount of effort in searching through the resources listed above. The developers have full time jobs, they have lives, families, the time they have available to contribute this project is a precious resource, make sure you use it wisely! Remember the more time we spend answering the same questions over and over again, less time goes into writing code, adding new features, actually fixing bugs!

### Bug Report
Delete this line and everything above, and then fill in the details below.

- **What version of the product are you using?**
    - What version are you using? Nuget? CI Nuget? build from a branch? If so which branch?
e.g. 53.0.1
    - Please only create an issue if you can reproduce the problem with the latest version.

- **What architecture x86 or x64?**

- **On what operating system?**
    - Win7, Win 8, Win10, etc?

- **Are you using `WinForms`, `WPF` or `OffScreen`?**

- **What steps will reproduce the problem?**
    - Please provide detailed information here, enough for someone else to reprodce your problem.
    - Please no binary (zip, etc) links, fork the [MinimalExample](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp.MinimalExample) and push your changes to `GitHub`. (Alternatively use a code sharing service list `Gist` or `Pastebin`).

- **What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**

- **Please provide any additional information below.**
    - A stack trace if available, any Exception information.

    - Does the cef log provide any relevant information? (By default there should be a debug.log file in your bin directory)

    - Any other background information that's relevant? Are you doing something out of the ordinary? 3rd party controls?

- **Does this problem also occur in the `CEF` Sample Application from http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html?**

    - To compare with WPF run cefclient --multi-threaded-message-loop --off-screen-rendering-enabled
    - To compare with WinForms run cefclient --multi-threaded-message-loop
    - If you can reproduce the problem with `cefclient` then you'll need to report the bug on https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/overview there is no point opening an issue here. (Make sure you search before opening an issue)
    - Please include the version you tested with e.g. `cef_binary_3.3029.1611.g44e39a8_windows64_client.tar.bz2`
