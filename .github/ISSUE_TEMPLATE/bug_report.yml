        To help determine where the problem needs to be fixed please download and test using the `CEF Sample Application(cefclient)`.
          1. Download for [x86](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/cef_binary_139.0.23%2Bg34a5b51%2Bchromium-139.0.7258.128_windows32_client.tar.bz2) or [x64](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/cef_binary_139.0.23%2Bg34a5b51%2Bchromium-139.0.7258.128_windows64_client.tar.bz2) or [arm64](https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/cef_binary_139.0.23%2Bg34a5b51%2Bchromium-139.0.7258.128_windowsarm64_client.tar.bz2).
          2. Extract tar.bz2 file
          3. Execute cefclient.exe using the **command line args below**:
          
          For WPF/OffScreen `cefclient.exe --multi-threaded-message-loop --no-sandbox --off-screen-rendering-enabled --enable-gpu`
          For WinForms `cefclient.exe --multi-threaded-message-loop --no-sandbox --use-alloy-style`

        If you can reproduce the problem with `cefclient` then please report the issue on [CEF Issue Tracker](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef/issues) (Make sure you search before opening an issue). If you open an issue here it will most likely be closed as `upstream` as the bug needs to be fixed in `CEF`.

        If you are seeing a crash in `libcef.dll` then please download `libcef.dll.pdb` and place it next to `libcef.dll` to obtain a detailed stack trace, see [FAQ](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/Trouble-Shooting#loading-native-symbols-for-easier-diagnosis) for details.
        Does the cef log provide any relevant information? (By default there should be a debug.log file in your bin directory)
        Any other background information that's relevant? Are you doing something out of the ordinary? 3rd party controls?
