`CefSharp` is a wrapper around the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/overview) in a lot of cases a feature must be added to `CEF` first before it can be used in `CefSharp`. `CEF` has it's own `Feature Request Forum` at https://magpcss.org/ceforum/viewforum.php?f=7
