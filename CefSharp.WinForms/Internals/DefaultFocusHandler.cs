            // If the WinForm ChromiumWebBrowser control is the 
            // current .ActiveControl before app activation

            // the CEF control AND having another control 
            // that should be the new .ActiveControl.
            //
            // For example:
            // * CEF control has focus, and thus ChromiumWebBrowser
            //   is the current .ActiveControl
            // * Alt-Tab to another application
            // * Click a non CEF control in the WinForms application.
            // * This begins the Windows activation process.
            // * The WM_ACTIVATE process on the WinForm UI thread
            //   will update .ActiveControl to the clicked control.
            //   The clicked control will receive WM_SETFOCUS as well. 
            //   (i.e. OnGotFocus)
            //   If the ChromiumWebBrowser was the previous .ActiveControl,
            //   then we set .Activating = true.
            // * The WM_ACTIVATE process on the CEF thread will
            //   send WM_SETFOCUS to CEF thus staring the race of
            //   which will end first, the WndProc WM_ACTIVATE process
            //   on the WinForm UI thread or the WM_ACTIVATE process
            //   on the CEF UI thread.
            // * CEF will then call this method on the CEF UI thread
            //   due to WM_SETFOCUS.
            // * This method will clear the activation state (if any)
            //   on the ChromiumWebBrowser control, due to the race
            //   condition the WinForm UI thread cannot.
