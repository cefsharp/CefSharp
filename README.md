[CefSharp](http://cefsharp.github.io/) lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About 30% of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.

CefSharp is [BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause "BSD License") licensed, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

## Releases

Stable binaries are released on NuGet, and contain everything you need  to embed Chromium in your .Net/CLR application. For usage see the [Quick Start](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/Quick-Start) guide or [FAQ #8](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#CefSharp_binaries).

They demo most of the available features.
* See the [CefSharp.MinimalExample](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp.MinimalExample/) project for a basic demo of using the CefSharp NuGet packages.
* See the [Wiki](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/wiki) for work-in-progress documentation

Please keep the `Issue Tracker` for **Bugs** only please! Before submitting a `PR` please read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cefsharp) as always is a useful resource, you can post your more complex issues here. The [CefSharp Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cefsharp) is **no longer active**. It is however a useful resource for archived questions/answers.

## Branches & Forks

This is the `official` CefSharp fork, as maintained by the CefSharp community. You can also view [the entire network of public forks/branches](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=cefsharp+fork%3Atrue&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).

*Note* Due to so many Forks - Github can't process them through the `Network Graphs` Section so, if you need to do a search use the following: `cefsharp fork:true` and it will be able to process all of the forks. 

Development is done in the `master` branch. New features are preferably added in feature branches, if the changes are more than trivial. New `PR's` should be targeted against `master`.

When a new release is imminent a `release` branch is created. We try to avoid making public facing `API` changes in `release` branches (Adding new features is fine, just not breaking changes).

## Financial Support

Creating regular releases of CefSharp is a time intensive process and so to support further development we ask if can contribute financially to the next release?
