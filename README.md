# CefSharp - Embedded Chromium for .NET

This project contains .NET CLR bindings for The
[Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/ "Google Code") by Marshall A. Greenblatt. The
bindings are written in C++/CLI but can be used from any CLR language, e.g. C# or VB. CefSharp provides both WinForms and WPF web
browser control implementations. See the CefSharp.WinForms.Example or CefSharp.Wpf.Example projects for example web browsers built
using this library; they are (at this moment) the best "documentation" of how the control can actually be used.

This project is [BSD](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php "BSD License") licensed, which means that it can be used from both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

See [Downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cefsharp/files/) page for older releases. Please note that the latest Stable
release is the only version officially supported; it's very unlikely that we will fix bugs in older releases.
