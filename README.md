[CefSharp](https://cefsharp.github.io/) lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper around the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) by Marshall A. Greenblatt. About 30% of the bindings are written in C++/CLI with the majority of code here is C#. It can be used from C# or VB, or any other CLR language. CefSharp provides both WPF and WinForms web browser control implementations.

CefSharp is [BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause "BSD License") licensed, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications. For the full details, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. 

If you like and use CefSharp please consider signing up for a small monthly donation, even $25 can help tremendously. See [Financial Support](#Financial-Support) for more details.

Please keep the `Issue Tracker` for **Bugs** only please! Before submitting a `PR` please read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Branches & Forks

This is the `official` CefSharp fork, as maintained by the CefSharp community. You can also view [the entire network of public forks/branches](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/network).

Development is done in the `master` branch. New features are preferably added in feature branches, if the changes are more than trivial. New `PR's` should be targeted against `master`.

When a new release is imminent a `release` branch is created. We try to avoid making public facing `API` changes in `release` branches (Adding new features is fine, just not breaking changes).

### Releases

**CI Builds**<br/>
Every commit on `master` produces a `Nuget` package. Use at your own risk!

## Financial Support

To continue developing/supporting the project I (@amaitland) am asking for financial contributions. Donations of any size are greatly appreciated!

Recurring contributions can be made through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/amaitland) it only takes a GitHub account and a credit card.  Currently GitHub is **doubling(!)** all pledges so is very much the preferred method of donation.  I can also take contributions through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/AlexMaitland).

Now that I (@amaitland) am a stay at home dad your contributions are the only reason I'm allowed to continue working on the project. Without continued funding the time I currently spend on the project will have to be put into finding other paid work.
